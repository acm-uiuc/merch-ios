## Requirements

XCode 8

iOS 10.2 SDK

An iPad running iOS 10.0 or newer

A Groot Client Key (more on this in API)

A code signing key from Apple is required to deploy apps to a device. Without a developer key, the app can only be installed on the iPhone/iPad Simulator.

## API

The project runs on ACM@UIUC Groot services, with routes specific to Merch maintained in https://github.com/acm-uiuc/groot-merch-service.

In order to access these services you will need a client key, which you can ask for on the Groot Gitter.
